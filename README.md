# USB Information Tool

## Description
This project is a simple console application written in C/C++.  
It reads basic information from a USB flash drive connected to the computer.

When a USB device is detected, the program displays:
- Device name
- Total storage size
- Free available space
- Basic device details

The project was made as a student team assignment to understand how USB storage devices work and how a program can interact with external hardware.

The application runs in the Windows console and is meant only for learning and testing purposes.
