Project: USB Storage Management Tool

1. USB DETECTION ON WINDOWS (C++)
---------------------------------
Windows provides several system APIs to detect USB storage devices:

A GetLogicalDrives()
   - Returns a bitmask representing all available drive letters.
   - Example: iterate letters A–Z to find connected drives.

B GetDriveTypeA("X:\\")
   - Checks the type of a drive.
   - DRIVE_REMOVABLE usually indicates a USB flash drive.
   - Simplest and most commonly used method.

C WM_DEVICECHANGE event
   - Triggered when devices are plugged in or removed.
   - Useful for event-driven programs.

D DeviceIoControl()
   - Advanced method to query hardware details.
   - Can obtain information like vendor, product, and storage type.
